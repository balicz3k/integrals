Project on calculating integrals using three typical methods

Description: This project focused on the computation of integrals, which is a key concept in mathematics. The goal was to implement and compare three typical methods commonly used for calculating integrals.

Methods:

Rectangular method:
The rectangular method, also known as the left, right, or midpoint rectangular method, involves dividing the integration interval into small rectangles and approximating the integral as the sum of the areas of these rectangles.

Trapezoidal method:
The trapezoidal method approximates the integral by fitting trapezoids under the curve of the function, connecting consecutive points on the interval.

Monte Carlo method:
The Monte Carlo method is a stochastic numerical technique. It involves randomly sampling points within the integration interval and estimating the integral based on the proportion of points falling under the curve.
